"""End-to-end integration test for the PyInstaller hook.

Builds a tiny Jac-only package (``__init__.jac`` markers, zero ``__init__.py``)
with PyInstaller and asserts the frozen binary runs and produces the expected
output. This is the acceptance test for the whole hook architecture: if it
passes, PR #5466's manual ``__init__.py`` scaffolding is no longer needed.

Skipped automatically when PyInstaller is not installed. A cold frozen build
typically takes 30-60 s, so expect the test to be slow.
